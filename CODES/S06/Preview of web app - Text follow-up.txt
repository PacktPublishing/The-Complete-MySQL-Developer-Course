Run the project go to OptIn page and try out some entries

You may run into an error if the FNAME and LNAME fields aren't set up in your db. Your challenge is to drop the OptIn table and create a new one, with the update FNAME and LNAME in place of NAME. Then it should work, if not, check the syntax for errors in receiver.php and SQLFunctions.php and the naming. 

You may also want to update SELECT * to SELECT COUNT(*) as count in the f_tableExists function of the SQLFunctions.php file
