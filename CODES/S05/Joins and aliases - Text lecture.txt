Joins and aliases - Text lecture
Section 5, Lecture 63
Join:

SELECT * 
FROM movies
    ,people
WHERE movies.DIRECTOR = people.ActorID ;

We simply list the tables with a comma to separate them and we define how the two tables relate to each other in the where clause.

When dealing with more than one table, we should always specify the table. Often times tables have columns with the same names and MySQL won’t know which one you want.  

Let's select some specific columns instead of all of them:  
SELECT movies.TITLE
      ,movies.RELEASE_YEAR
      ,movies.RATING
      ,CONCAT(people.FIRST_NAME,' ',people.LAST_NAME) AS Director
FROM movies
    ,people
WHERE movies.DIRECTOR = people.ActorID ;

While specifying the table is necessary in many situations, and always a good habit, it causes a Lot of typing and can make the code look overwhelming. Which is why we use aliases

Aliases

SELECT A.TITLE
      ,A.RELEASE_YEAR
      ,A.RATING
      ,CONCAT(B.FIRST_NAME,' ',B.LAST_NAME) AS Director
FROM movies A
    ,people B
WHERE A.DIRECTOR = B.ActorID ;

You can use anything as the alias, but I have found that simply using from letters A-Z for each table is the best way. It’s clean and straightforward. All of the examples and code going forward will incorporate this type of aliasing.
