SELECT * FROM actors;

SELECT * FROM movies;

-> SELECT section lists the results to be returned.
* Means everything
From is where you list tables.
We will add lots of extra details but the SELECT * FROM is the general structure of how we retrieve any and all data from the database.

Listing the columns returns the same results as *
SELECT ActorID
      ,FIRST_NAME
      ,LAST_NAME
FROM actors; 
  
SELECT FIRST_NAME
      ,LAST_NAME
FROM actors;   
Returns same number of rows, but only the columns that were requested (FIRST_NAME AND LAST_NAME)
