Where and not equal - Text lecture
Section 3, Lecture 37
In section 2 we looked at where but didn’t dive very far into it. Now we will explore more options of the Where Clause….

Where is how we control which rows are returned.  

Example:
SELECT Title
FROM movies
WHERE 1=1;

Always true, so return every title for all movies(rows) in the table.

SELECT 1 As Result
FROM movies
WHERE 1=1;

SELECT 1 As Result
FROM movies
WHERE Rating=’PG’;

It’s important to see that WHERE only controls which rows are returned, but has no other effect on what data actually returns.

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE RATING = "PG" 
 AND Title LIKE "Night%";

You can string as may conditions together as you need using AND

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE RATING = "PG" 
 AND Title NOT LIKE "Night%";

NOT allows you to define what you don’t want displayed.
