Challenge: Delete With Joins

Objective: Delete all people from the people table that have never been a director.

Step 1: Plan it out using a select Statement
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM people; 
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM people A
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1
                  FROM movies Z
                  WHERE Z.Director = A.ActorID);
Sometimes it’s helpful to view what you are going to be deleting in terms of row count

SELECT *
FROM people A
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1
                  FROM movies Z
                  WHERE Z.Director = A.ActorID);   
                 
Step 2: Update the Select into a Delete and Execute
DELETE
FROM people 
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1
                  FROM movies Z
                  WHERE Z.Director = ActorID);  

Step 3: Confirm your results
SELECT * FROM people;
