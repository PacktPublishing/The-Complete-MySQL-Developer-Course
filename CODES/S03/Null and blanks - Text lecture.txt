Null and blanks - Text lecture
Section 3, Lecture 43
Let's add more data to help explore the issue of null and empty string: 

INSERT INTO movies (title, rating)
VALUES
  ('DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story' ,'PG-13')
  ,('Along Came Polly','PG-13')
  ,('Anchorman:The Legend of Ron Burgundy','PG-13');

INSERT INTO movies (title, release_year)
VALUES
  ('Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues' ,2013)
  ,('Megamind',2010);

INSERT INTO movies (title, rating)
VALUES('Fight Club','');

NULL Means there is no data.  This happens all the time depending on the data you are dealing with. The issue comes is when you are trying come compare a non-existent value (null) to anything

SELECT * 
FROM movies
WHERE NOT rating = 'PG-13'
 AND  NOT rating = 'PG'
 AND  NOT rating = 'R';

Where did Anchorman 2 and Megamind go?

SELECT * 
FROM movies
WHERE rating IS NULL;

The issue is we were comparing NULL (a non existent value) to a value. Non-existent values don't equal anything. “IS NULL” and IS NOT NULL” compares the field in a way that will return content in these scenarios.

SELECT * 
FROM movies
WHERE rating = 'R'
      OR rating IS NULL;

We can compare a string to an empty string.
SELECT * 
FROM movies
WHERE rating = 'R'
      OR rating = ‘’;

SELECT * 
FROM movies
WHERE rating = 'R'
      OR IFNULL(rating,'') = ''; 

IFNULL(A, B) where A is the field to be compared and B is the default value to be used when NULL is found.  Oracle uses NVL and SQL Server uses ISNULL
