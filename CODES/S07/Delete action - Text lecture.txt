Delete action - Text lecture
Section 7, Lecture 111
Delete ->

Create a new field titled DeleteToDo.php
This file will take the input from a POST, and delete the corresponding ToDo row.
<?php
  include('SQLFunctions.php');

/*if anything is in the Post, assign the $tdID variable with the ID from the post*/
if ( !empty($_POST)) {
  $tdID = $_POST['q'];
   /*Open the database connection based on config.php file settings*/
  $link = connectDB();

  /*Prepare the SQL Delete Statement using the ID from the POST*/
  $sql = "DELETE
          FROM ToDos
          WHERE ToDoId = ".$tdID.";";
  echo "sql:".$sql." Comment this out after testing"; 
  
  /*Attempt Delete*/
  if (mysqli_query($link, $sql)) {
      echo "<br>Delete record successfully";
  } else {
      echo  "<br>Error: " . $sql . "<br>" . mysqli_error($link);
  }

/*Close database connection*/
mysqli_close ( $link );

/*Forwared User Back to Main View*/ 
/*header("Location: ToDoApp.php");  uncomment this after testing*/
}
?>

To Test it, we will need to update ToDoApp.php
Update the while statement on ToDoApp.php and add a delete button under update, ensure you've moved the </td> to the end of the delete button from the update
      while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result))  {
        echo "<tr>";
          echo "<td>{$row[0]}</td>";
          echo "<td>{$row[1]}</td>";
          echo "<td>{$row[2]}</td>";
          echo "<td><form action='UpdateToDo.php' method = '_POST' onsubmit='' /> <input type='hidden' name='q' value='".$row[3]."' /><input type='Submit' value='Update'></form>";
          echo "<form action='DeleteToDo.php' method = '_POST' onsubmit='' /> <input type='hidden' name='q' value='".$row[3]."' /><input type='Submit' value='Delete'></form></td>";
        echo "</tr>";
      } 

Now test it out.  You will quickly find that you can delete rows with the touch of a button.

Once tested, Update the DeleteToDo.php
Comment out the echo sql
Uncomment the header Location ToDoApp.php at the end. Test out the functions of the ToDo app and enjoy!
