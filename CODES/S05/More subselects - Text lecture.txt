More subselects - Text lecture
Section 5, Lecture 75
SUBSELECTS are also useful when you want to refer to a table but don’t plan on returning results from that additional table.

Let’s try to pull a list of people who have directed movies, but we don’t care to display anything from the movies.

SELECT A.FIRST_NAME
      ,A.LAST_NAME
FROM people A
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1
              FROM movies Z
              WHERE Z.Director = A.ActorID) 
GROUP BY A.FIRST_NAME
        ,A.LAST_NAME;  

Notice that they SELECT is set to return 1.  You need to have a select statement, but there is no point in specifying anything there as it will not be used.

Another alternative to accomplish the same thing is using IN.  The statement Z.Director = A.ActorID is removed and replaced by putting 1 and only one column in the SELECT statement (Z.Director) and replacing ‘EXISTS’ with ‘A.ActorID IN’
SELECT A.FIRST_NAME
      ,A.LAST_NAME
FROM people A
WHERE A.ActorID IN (SELECT Z.Director
                    FROM movies Z) 
GROUP BY A.FIRST_NAME
        ,A.LAST_NAME;  

We can use NOT to find anyone on the People table who has never directed a movie
SELECT A.FIRST_NAME
      ,A.LAST_NAME
FROM people A
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1
                  FROM movies Z
                  WHERE Z.Director = A.ActorID) 
GROUP BY A.FIRST_NAME
        ,A.LAST_NAME; 

Similarly, we can use NOT IN to find the same information:

SELECT A.FIRST_NAME
      ,A.LAST_NAME
FROM people A
WHERE A.ActorID NOT IN (SELECT Z.Director
                        FROM movies Z) 
GROUP BY A.FIRST_NAME
        ,A.LAST_NAME;
