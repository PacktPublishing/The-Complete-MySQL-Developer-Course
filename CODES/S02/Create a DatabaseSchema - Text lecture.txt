Create a Database/Schema - Text lecture
Section 2, Lecture 9
Database Server: Service running on a machine (server or desktop), it houses many databases.

Database: Contains all of the persistent information for your applications

Schema: In MySQL, this is synonymous with database and can be used interchangeably, but shouldn’t because SQL Server and Oracle treat them differently. 
SQL Server/Oracle - Schema is a namespace inside the database with different permissions associated with it.

To clear screen from mysql cli -> \! clear

Open MySQL ->
Type : mysql-ctl cli

Some commands ->

show databases;

show schemas;

SQL statements end with “;”
If you don’t put the “;”, MySQL will wait to execute until you ad it in.

To create a new database ->
create database project1;

MySQL is case sensitive.
Don’t put spaces in the database name.  While possible, it will just cause issues later..  Spaces generally cause annoyances in names of databases, tables, columns and everything.

create schema project1; this statement would accomplish the same thing as the command above to create database

Create another database ->
create database mashrur1;

show databases;

To delete (or drop) the database mashrur1 (warning: this will immediately delete it) ->
drop database mashrur1;

To use a specific database for queries we'll be running and impacting (let's say we want this to be project1):
use project1;

Now when we create and do things like create objects or call objects, database “project1” is assumed.
Note: up arrow recalls previous commands.
