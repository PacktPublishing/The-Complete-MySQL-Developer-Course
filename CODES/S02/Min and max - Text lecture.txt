They work exactly how you would expect.

SELECT Title
      ,MAX(ReleaseYear)
      ,RATING
FROM movies;
*Incorrect results

SELECT MIN(ReleaseYear)
      ,RATING
FROM movies
WHERE Title like 'Night at the Museum%'
GROUP BY Title
        ,RATING;

SELECT RATING
      ,MIN(ReleaseYear)
FROM movies
WHERE Title like 'Night at the Museum%'
GROUP BY RATING;

SELECT RATING
      ,MIN(ReleaseYear)
FROM movies
GROUP BY RATING;

SELECT RATING
      ,MAX(ReleaseYear)
FROM movies
GROUP BY RATING;

MySQL is more “flexible” than other SQL versions.  It doesn’t require the GROUP BY but it should.  It is likely you will get unhelpful or incorrect results when you do not use a group by.

All result sets should either be part of an aggregate function, or in the Group By.
