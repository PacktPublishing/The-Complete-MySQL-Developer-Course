Left outer joins - Text lecture
Section 5, Lecture 69
Let's say we want to report all of the actors and the movies that they directed:

SELECT A.FIRST_NAME
      ,A.LAST_NAME
      ,B.TITLE AS Directed
      ,B.RELEASE_YEAR
FROM people A
      INNER JOIN movies B
        ON B.DIRECTOR = A.ActorID;

If I want to have rows from the people table returned whether or not they directed a movie, I can use a left outer join:

SELECT A.FIRST_NAME
      ,A.LAST_NAME
      ,B.TITLE AS Directed
      ,B.RELEASE_YEAR
FROM people A
      LEFT OUTER JOIN movies B
        ON B.DIRECTOR = A.ActorID;

We can couple this concept with functions we discussed earlier like Min and Max

SELECT A.FIRST_NAME
      ,A.LAST_NAME
      ,MIN(C.RELEASE_YEAR) AS FirstDirected
      ,MAX(B.RELEASE_YEAR) AS LatestRelease
FROM people A
     LEFT OUTER JOIN movies B
      ON B.DIRECTOR = A.ActorID
     LEFT OUTER JOIN movies C
      ON C.DIRECTOR = A.ActorID
GROUP BY A.FIRST_NAME ,A.LAST_NAME
ORDER BY COUNT(B.MovieID) DESC;

When your joining tables, you can join them to the primary table or any table, but it is important to keep them in a logical order so that you can troubleshoot if you run into unexpected results.

SELECT A.FIRST_NAME
      ,A.LAST_NAME
      ,IFNULL(MIN(C.ReleaseYear),'N/A') AS FirstDirected
      ,IFNULL(MAX(B.ReleaseYear),'N/A') AS LatestRelease
FROM people A
      LEFT OUTER JOIN movies B
       ON B.director = A.ActorID
      LEFT OUTER JOIN movies C
       ON C.director = B.director   
GROUP BY A.FIRST_NAME
        ,A.LAST_NAME;
