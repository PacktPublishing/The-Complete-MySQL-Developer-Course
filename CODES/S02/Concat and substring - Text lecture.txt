Concat and substring - Text lecture
Section 2, Lecture 18
CONCAT - Use to add columns together for display

SELECT CONCAT(LAST_NAME, ', ', FIRST_NAME)
FROM actors;    

Returns same number of rows, but with our calculated row.

SQL lets you rename columns for display as well:
SELECT CONCAT(LAST_NAME, ', ', FIRST_NAME) AS ACTOR_NAME
FROM actors;      

To grab certain data from the rows under a column (instead of all the data) you can use substring:
SELECT LAST_NAME, SUBSTRING(LAST_NAME,1,3)
FROM actors;  

A useful query to generate user name from first_name and last_name columns:
SELECT FIRST_NAME
      ,LAST_NAME
      ,SUBSTRING(FIRST_NAME,1,1)
      ,CONCAT(SUBSTRING(FIRST_NAME,1,1),LAST_NAME) AS USER_NAME
FROM actors;  

Select allows you to name columns with spaces using “”, you can create new columns, and calculate columns.  You can reuse columns for basically anything.

SELECT CONCAT(LAST_NAME, ', ', FIRST_NAME) AS "Actor's Names"
      ,LAST_NAME AS LNAME
      ,FIRST_NAME AS "First Name"
      ,CONCAT(SUBSTRING(FIRST_NAME,1,1),LAST_NAME) AS USER_NAME
      ,'Any Text' AS Anything
      ,1+2        AS Math
FROM actors;
