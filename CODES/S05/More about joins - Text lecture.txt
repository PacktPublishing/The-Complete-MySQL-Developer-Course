Let’s Join Movies with Characters

SELECT A.TITLE
      ,A.RELEASE_YEAR
      ,A.RATING
      ,B.CharacterName
      ,B.ActorID
FROM movies A
    ,characters B
WHERE A.MovieID = B.MovieID;

We can add additional tables:
SELECT A.TITLE
      ,A.RELEASE_YEAR
      ,A.RATING
      ,B.CharacterName
      ,CONCAT(C.FIRST_NAME,' ',C.LAST_NAME) AS Actor
FROM movies A
    ,characters B
    ,people C
WHERE A.MovieID = B.MovieID 
 AND  B.ActorID  = C.ActorID;

We can reference the same table multiple times to pull information for various reasons. In the case below, we are using the People table to provide the name of both the directors and the actors

SELECT A.TITLE
      ,CONCAT(D.FIRST_NAME,' ',D.LAST_NAME) AS Director
      ,A.RELEASE_YEAR
      ,A.RATING
      ,B.CharacterName
      ,CONCAT(C.FIRST_NAME,' ',C.LAST_NAME) AS Actor
FROM movies A
    ,characters B
    ,people C
    ,people D
WHERE A.MovieID  = B.MovieID 
 AND  B.ActorID  = C.ActorID
 AND  A.DIRECTOR = D.ActorID
 AND  A.TITLE LIKE 'Zoo%';

This can be written a different way. Listing tables in the FROM and joining them in the WHERE is perfectly acceptable, you can also join tables by putting everything in the FROM:

SELECT A.TITLE
      ,CONCAT(D.FIRST_NAME,' ',D.LAST_NAME) AS Director
      ,A.RELEASE_YEAR
      ,A.RATING
      ,B.CharacterName
      ,CONCAT(C.FIRST_NAME,' ',C.LAST_NAME) AS Actor
FROM movies A
       INNER JOIN characters B
         ON A.MovieID  = B.MovieID 
       INNER JOIN people C
         ON B.ActorID  = C.ActorID  
       INNER JOIN people D
         ON A.DIRECTOR = D.ActorID
WHERE A.TITLE LIKE 'Zoo%';

Both of these joins are Inner Joins. They mean that all of the rows in all of the tables need to exist. If no actors were listed for a movie, the movie won't show on the list. If no movies are associated with that actor, the actor won’t be returned.
