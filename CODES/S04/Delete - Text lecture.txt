Delete - Text lecture
Section 4, Lecture 57
Delete is just like Select but instead of returning rows with information, it removes them from the table. As a rule, always use a select statement to verify what you are about to remove.

Example, remove all of the inactive accounts from our CustBal table:

First, identify the inactive accounts:
SELECT *
FROM CustBal 
WHERE ActiveStatus = 0;

To delete, replace SELECT * with DELETE and execute;
DELETE 
FROM CustBal 
WHERE ActiveStatus = 0;
